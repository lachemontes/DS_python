    "\n",
    "✔ Easy Data Handling – Load, clean, and manipulate datasets efficiently.<br>\n",
    "✔ Data Analysis & Aggregation – Perform filtering, grouping, and statistical operations.<br>\n",
    "✔ Data Visualization – Works well with Matplotlib and Seaborn for charts and graphs.<br>\n",
    "✔ File Support – Read and write CSV, Excel, SQL, JSON, and more.<br>\n",
    "✔ Indexing & Slicing – Quick access to specific rows and columns.<br>\n",
