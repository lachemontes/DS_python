    "You will learn how to visualize data and to store data in new data structures. Along the way, you will master control structures, which you will need to customize the flow of your scripts and algorithms. These are the types of things data scientists use every day. We'll finish this chapter with a case study, where you'll blend together everything you've learned to solve an exciting challenge."

    "I have a list with years here, year, and a list with corresponding populations, expressed in billions, pop. In the year 1970, for example, 3.7 billion people lived on planet Earth. To plot this data as a line chart, we call plt-dot-plot and use our two lists as arguments. The first argument corresponds to the horizontal axis, and the second one to the vertical axis. You might think that a plot will pop up right now, but Python's pretty lazy. It will wait for the show function to actually display the plot. This is because you might want to add some extra ingredients to your plot before actually displaying it, such as titles and label customizations. I'll talk about that some more later on. Just remember this: the plot function tells Python what to plot and how to plot it. show actually displays the plot."
