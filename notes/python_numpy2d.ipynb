    "You can create a 2D numpy array from a regular Python list of lists. Let's try to create one numpy array for all height and weight data of your family, like this. If you print out np_2d now, you'll see that it is a rectangular data structure: Each sublist in the list, corresponds to a row in the two dimensional numpy array. From np_2d.shape, you can see that we indeed have 2 rows and 5 columns. shape is a so-called attribute of the np2d array, that can give you more information about what the data structure looks like. Note that the syntax for accessing an attribute looks a bit like calling a method, but they are not the same! Remember that methods have round brackets after them, and, you can see here, attributes do not. Also for 2D arrays, the NumPy rule applies: an array can only contain a single type. If you change one float to be string, all the array elements will be coerced to strings, to end up with a homogeneous array."
