Each variable then represents a single value. As a data scientist, you'll often want to work with many data points.

A list is a way to give a single name to a collection of values.

One for liz, one for emma and so on. Now, you can tell Python that these sublists are the elements of another list, that I named fam2: the little lists are wrapped in square brackets and separated with commas. If you now print out fam2, you see that we have a list of lists. The main list contains 4 sub-lists.
