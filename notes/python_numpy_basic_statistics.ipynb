    "# Basic statistics with Numpy\n",
    "Imagine you conduct a city-wide survey where you ask 5000 adults about their height and weight. You end up with something like this: a 2D numpy array, which I named np_city, that has 5000 rows, corresponding to the 5000 people, and two columns, corresponding to the height and the weight. Simply staring at these numbers like a zombie won't give you any insights. What you can do, though, is generate summarizing statistics about your data"
